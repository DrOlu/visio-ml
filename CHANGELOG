CHANGES
-------

Week 1 (Partial)

 - Fresh top-level views using only SwiftUI layout primitives to prevent recurrent bugs (no more AppKit views)
 - Re-designed viewer area, toolbar, navigator, inspector, status bar
 - Show/hide navigator with animation from the toolbar
 - New open button with extended functionality (display and clear folder)
 - Pick active image for viewing (single selection) or mark images for processing (multiple selection)
 - New inspector tabs implementation
 - New coordinate system for viewer
 - New internal annotation representation (closer to CoreML API)
 - Re-imagined synthetics container panel and new modal dialog architecture
 - Better status, help and empty-state messages
 - Smooth image viewer and visual annotation manipulation (fixed severe performance issue)
 - Support for re-positioning annotations (drag-and-drop)


Week 2

 - Launch state improved with hidden/disabled controls and call to action
 - Filters overhauled to handle chaining and arbitrary combinations
 - Synthetic generation now non-blocking, allows user to keep interacting with main app window
 - Synthetics progress report improved and moved to the status bar
 - Separated filters (scale, rotate,…) from inside the background filter implementation
 - Migrated more filters (noise, emboss)
 - Refreshed the synthetics modal to reflect the available filters
 - Enabled new filter combinations
 - Initial keyboard support
 - Background filter, initial implementation
 - Key bindings for move up / down (select image), delete annotation
 - Improvements to synthetics UI
 - Sepparate facility to store and pass synthetics options
 - Crop filter!
 - New curated and tested filter combinations
 - Total of synthetics to be created before hitting generate
 - Automatically saving/restoring workspace (synthetics background setting)


Week 3

 - Project updated with new bundle ID, product display name, signing config, repository now public
 - More settings now automatically saved to workspace: Apply to marked images only, Apply N times
 - Ability to exclude specific filters, included by default in synthetics generation
 - Numeric validation implemented for the "Apply N times" field
 - Resilliency to invalid/outdated workspace JSON file. It no longer crashes when format is invalid.
 - Now honouring apply N times in generating synthetics
 - Disable "Generate…" button when image selection results in empty dataset
 - Now honouring filter exclusion list in generating synthetics
 - Specific filters can now be disabled resulting in multiple combinations being excluded
 - "Generate N images" count takes "Apply N times" and disabled filter combinations into consideration
 - New settings layout including checkbox and text field and filter list alignment. Copy also revised.


KNOWN ISSUES
------------

 - Pressing del, up/down performs the expected action but also sounds an alert
 - Image navigator does not automatically scroll while selecting items using keyboard
 - [SOLVED] Synthetics interface does not yet allow for picking specific filters
 - UI freezes briefly when too many images are about to be generated
 - Incompatible with previous version workspace (remove .visioannotate folder to work-around this issue)
 - [TBC] Sometimes empty PNGs are generated and reported not to be written to disk (when random extent bounds are zero)
 - [CONFIRMED] Sometimes the image inspector is active showing a file missing note instead of "no active/selected image"
