KNOWN ISSUES
------------

 - Pressing del, up/down performs the expected action but also sounds an alert
 - Image navigator does not automatically scroll while selecting items using keyboard
 - Synthetics interface does not yet allow for picking specific filters
 - UI freezes briefly when too many images are about to be generated
 - Incompatible with previous version workspace (remove .visioannotate folder to work-around this issue)
 - [NEEDS CONFIRMATION] Sometimes empty PNGs are generated and reported not to be written to disk
 - [NEEDS CONFIRMATION] Sometimes the image inspector is active showing a file missing note instead of "no active/selected image"
